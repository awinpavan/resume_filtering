#🧠 Resume Filtering with LLM-based Scoring
This project automates the resume screening process using Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Groq API. It helps recruiters and HR professionals streamline candidate evaluation by comparing resumes to a predefined job description, scoring them intelligently, and categorizing them into selected or rejected based on match relevance.
